"A shambles, completely unorganised and clearly more interested in making a profit than supporting students",0
"This school is absolute b******. I'm in the MSC computing professional placement program and paying a load of money for half ass professors, outdated material and all of my school mates are PISSED. Do not waste your time on this school. They will charge you a stupid amount of money for no education. Udemy has better courses than this s***** school. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",0
"As an international student, lecturers are great, online resources is there when i need them!",1
"I have had a terrible experience at this university and have considered quitting my post graduate several times since arriving.
Had issues with registration and after going through 6 different members of staff one was very apologetic which I accepted and assumed they were just very busy at that time of year, the lady that was apologetic said she would E-mail me back - its 4 months later and I have still never heard back.
I had to give the campus facilities a low rating - it is probably unfair however the only services I have tried using was email and logging into computers on campus, my email didn't work and my login didn't work either.
Had issues with student counselling team - whenever I have been in contact they have been excellent (one of the redeeming features of the university) - however have not heard back once or twice.
Travel, Lecturer issues, lack of help over coronavirus have made for an awful personal experience where I might quit.",0
"I do love my university. The staff are extremely helpful and ready to aid you. The professors always take time for their students and getting career or study advice is no issue. My postgrad might not have been as challenging as I'd hoped for, but I still feel like it was worth it. Theory was always closely linked to real life situations and we spent a lot of time analysing case studies and applying theory. I loved the structure, the facilities and the staff.",1
I think that napier is an excellent uni and has good facilities,1
Never ending problems with phishing emails.,0
Some of the modules are ridiculous and the students union are terrible.,0
Very good I have been very happy with all facilities,1
There's lots to do in all Napier campuses and lots of places to concentrate on studying.,1
"Enrolled on an MA design course with a focus in Motion Graphics. The course was hardly orientated around Motion Graphics with pointless and non-beneficial modules which had barely any relation to the name of the course. One module, in particular, that was an option was purposely made to feel unappealing by the tutor who said: ""you will struggle if you take this module"". The organisation from tutors was very poor and the structure of the course felt all over the place. As for the university itself, it feels more like a college, not a very appealing campus (Merchiston). Save your money and learn elsewhere, I feel bad for anyone starting this year.",0
Im at the sighthill campus doing nursing. Placement experiences are great. Lectures (if they are organised well) tend to be very imformative and relevant. Lectures can be a bit all over the place and can sometimes not understand what you’re asking. Alot of home working.,1
"Very disappointing overall. The university staff weren’t particularly friendly with my head lecturer being an egotistical bully who singled me out on multiple occasions. While the facilities and resources were impressive, everything was heavily restricted, being very look but don’t touch. Ended up leaving after the one year. Just wasn’t worth it.",0
"The gym and library are great, there are not many societies but the student union is based at one of the best pubs in Edinburgh",1
"Campus perfect, everything you could need",1
"Never joined a club, but plenty were offered. Same with student union but I heard good things about em. Lots of career services available for students and wifi accessible from anywhere on campus.",1
Really good. Lots of help. Union is cheap but a bit of a trek from majority of accommodation.,1
"Napier is great, but Sighthill needs more table space/staggered lunchtimes, and the WiFi is a bit rubbish. Vet nurses have very good employability rates though, and I do enjoy my classes. V good uni, but you will be mocked mercilessly by the snobs from UoE and Heriott-Watt.",1
"It's a modern building with great facilities, the sport science labs all have new equipment and the lecturers are so helpful!",1
"Really good uni, tutors always offer a lot of help and social life is amazing in Edinburgh. All round good university life from Edinburgh Napier.",1
"Fantastic modern learning facility, routine improvements to campus life and looking out for the environment. A university that also has the second highest employment/further education rates in Scotland.",1
"Not only is the university good on an academic level but also has a hugh employment rate. They push you to go out in the real world and gain experience with companies in order to prepare you for when you graduate. The clubs and societies are run so well and you really feel like you're part of a community. The NSA always organise great events and activities throughout the year, especially at freshers week! Highly recommend going to this university.",1
"teaching staff are mainly horrendously bad and facilities are pretty appalling, but it's probably not too bad if you're Scottish and get it all for free, think twice if you're a fee payer though!",0
"Campus's are nice and in good locations, except for Sighthill campus which is a bit out of the way to get to. Decent clubs and societies however there could be more to cater for more people. Haven't had any issues with wifi so far with it being decent in both halls and within the campuses, however in halls it can be very temperamental.",1
Napier is a fun and friendly university. It offers a great range of courses and there are a lot of opportunities.,1
