"Having previously studied at another university, which I loved, I found Aberdeen lacked the same quality of nightlife, societies, teaching and student union. I found myself resenting my subject choice and decision to pursue a postgraduate degree as I was so miserable there.",0
"Aberdeen University is excellent. They provide traditional, high class education that rivals what is on offer from neighbouring institutions across the UK. All the buildings are close by.
Only a short bus journey or 30 minute walk into the centre where all the shops, pubs, and cafes are.
Much more international than expected - but still some locals/rUK.
Class sizes are small, that made me feel valued and that staff had time for me, even in 1st year. Sometimes it felt like I was at an Ivy league/RG because of the small tutorials and class sizes (3rd year on wards). They are completing a new science building so lab classes will be in state of the art facilities.
OK - not everyone likes the library because of space issues, but there are many quiet places on campus to study.
Probably one of the best non-Russell group Unis. My undergrad experience here was much better than a higher ranking University I went to after. Rankings don't mean anything.",1
"The personal attention in this university could not be better, every lecturer is always there to help, the societies available are more than you could ever imagine and being part of one changes your live.",1
Easy to get around once you get familiar with.,1
"Good uni , good facilities. Library is nice, only downside is I wish it was 24 hours all year round.",1
You will love it! The campus is so attractive! The teachers are so patient!,1
The University of Aberdeen is the best!,1
The University of Aberdeen is the best!,1
I do not regret coming to study at the University of Aberdeen. I totally recommend.,1
Im so far enjoying uni life and Aberdeen was definitely the right choice for me:),1
"Great place to study, has great variety of courses and staff are so helpful and friendly. There is many events with the student union and with societies/clubs etc for you to participate in and make friends!",1
University of Aberdeen was my first choice from the start and I was right! It is an amazing university that provides a lot of opportunities!,1
Academic teaching well delivered with loads of extra curriculum activities. In the heart of Aberdeen and not far from city centre activities for weekend entertainment,1
"Positives: library is really modern and amazing to study in, the number of international students is really high which makes meeting people from all over the world really easy.
Negatives: If you want to study business at this uni: don't, business school is an absolute joke and uni doesn't seem to care. The city is very small, grey and there isn't much going on (besides society events). It's also not bike friendly.",1

Great university to go to! Really prestigious and honourable!,1
"Good University, very helpful staff.",1
lacks a good social atmosphere so it’s easy to become a recluse. ,0
"The uni really has everything that you could expect. It’s a fairly classic setup, it’s not boring and it’s conducive to a classic uni experience. There’s lots of things to do it’s just a matter of exploring. The student union also send endless emails so it’s impossible not to know what’s going on.",1
"I am currently studying Civil Engineering and cannot recommend the University enough. As a previous Marine Biology student of Stirling University, I am blown away by what it is to finally have a real education (do not go to Stirling, seriously).
The teaching facilities and top class and the Duncan Rice library is something to behold, although I cant help but think how many more computers they could fit on each floor if it weren't for the big holes in the middle.
Aberdeen Sports Village is in partnership with the University and has everything: Huge gym, indoor and outdoor running tracks, 2 full size football pitches (indoor and out door), 2 hockey pitches, 50 metre pool, Olympic dive pool and much more - all available to students at a cheap price.
There are several places to eat and socialise from Starbucks to food courts, but no traditional union to speak of. Instead we have The Bobbin and Red Lion - bars practically on campus.
Phenomenal student support! We are valued.",1
"a great University, there is many societies you can join and the facilities on campus are very good. Libary is also very useful when you just want a quiet space to study (if you can find a space).",1
There are very good facilities in this university.,1
"Only problem I have with campus is there's no bar in the students union, unlike most other unis which I've heard about",0
"I entered Aberdeen University in 2014 and was one of the 'mature' students put into temporary accommodation. I felt very segregated because of this because I was not put into halls like most students and this made my social life more far more difficult - which was incredibly unhelpful as a music student. I had a very long and arduous battle just to get into the university. Having now graduated I sometimes wish I never have had bothered putting myself through such a ordeal but there were few benefits - finding work/experience and meeting new people (eventually). I was also dyslexic and had other learning difficulties and I really felt 3rd and 4th year just went really downhill - I was very unhappy with how the course was run with the communities programme, lecturers for various reasons, no help from dyslexic advisor (off all term) combined with strike action on another course I was studying and I could feel my physical and mental health failing.",0
"good university, campus is nice",0
"Uni is a good school, I enjoy attending it. Courses are well constructed and there is lot of effort out into providing students with outside school activities such as sports clubs or various societies.",1
Avoid at all costs. Lazy pretentious run down university. Lecturers are rude and lazy and unhelpful. Depressed as the students are.,0
The university is just as it should be,1
Best university for experience and studies,1
Studying is fun and cool and all the other fun things in the dictionary,1
"University has a lovely campus, their support for students could be a tad better however",1
The university is a great place to study.,1
"great university, accommodation is a five minute walk from the campus",1
It's very interesting staying here eilidh is the best worker,1
"The university of Aberdeen is one of the best universities, when it comes to issues or personal problems they are always understanding and always try and help, and for that I am forever grateful for, the campus itself is a,among and unique and studying there has been an experience that I will not forget",1
Nice and central to accommodation,1
More access to facilities such as kettles and microwaves,0
Really great establishment. Love it.,1
"Wifi doesn't work on most laptops and most lecturers are rude, campus is nice though",0
I really love attending this university and I am getting a great education for my degree.,1
University of Aberdeen is such a peaceful place where is suitable to study and research. Many needed sources are already provided at library in the Uni,1
the staff could be more helpful,0
"The university is excellent, pity the same can't be said for the accommodation.",0
Happy to be part of Aberdeen Uni. Quaint and beautiful. I love my degree,1
Good university and nice people,1
Good university and nice people,1
"Great university, great university",1
it is nice and the buildings are cute,1
it is such is a great and beautiful campus,1
Good competition and amazing faculties,1
"NICE PLACE TO STUDY, NICE LIBERARY! And I got so many friends in this year!",1
Did not attend due to moving back home to NI,1
V. Poor course choices with other problems that needs fixing. ,0
"While considered one of the ancient universities, there is little celebration of history or traditions present. The campus is worn and classrooms need to be cleaned/repaired/painted; too much is paid to executive salaries and not enough spent on upkeep or student enrichment. Leadership is mediocre and does not run the university as a modern institution, too much micromanagement. It craves international students but provides zero support and has been outright hostile in their treatment of them. Faculty are overworked and not able to reach the potential they could if academic units were staffed appropriately, and there is too much reliance on the student union to address student needs with the university not doing nearly enough. Don't go here if you have other options.",0
good university and student life,1
Worst place for international students. Openly racist lecturers. I regret wasting my money there.,0
"Great university to be at, escpacially for oil and gas studies, its very easy to get a job afterwards.",1
"The city is grey, cold and depressing, personal and mental health support is almost non-existent, Student Union is inactive, very little sense of student community, nothing to do in the city except a few pubs and clubs and a cinema, transport is expensive, no good social spaces for students (even if you're not very social it's nice to have somewhere to hang out between lectures). I would highly recommend not going here if you have poor mental health/aren't outgoing.",0
"beautiful main campus, well-stocked, spacious & awesome library, lecturers seemed professional, passionate & eager to share their own research (in the Archaeology & Anthropology department anyway), course feedback is helpful (though often late), easy to change courses or apply for exchange, loads of interesting societies.

"A miserable, tacky, trashy, basic, nouveau-rich hellhole. Aberdeen has to be the world's most depressing city. Unless, you want to have a miserable student life and to develop suicidal toughts, avoid this university at all costs!
Aberdeen's weather is on a league of its own. It's excruciatingly cold, dark, rainy and insanely WINDY throughout the whole year. The fact that every single building is Aberdeen is GREY and made out of cold, dour granite, further contributes to inducing the locals into a state of utter despair and depression. Everyone in Aberdeen seems to be either drunk or depressed at all times.
No words can quite describe how utterly miserable Aberdeen is during the winter. The whole city is empty and devoid of life as there's very little to do since the city's main avenue is scattered with trahsy one-pound shops and McDonalds.
The uni itself is not bad (pretty much a mid-rank uni for average/below-average students). However, the city itself is utterly miserable. Avoid!",0
Uni has everything I need and glad I chose it.,1
"Not only as a researcher, anybody who studies and work at the School of engineering should be provided with reasonable working environment. School of engineering doesn't really care about providing the reasonable working environment for researchers, research students in general. Administrative service will keep you update with so many excuses but no solution in reality especially you are the only one who asking for help to solve an issue.",0
The university as a whole is amazing,1
"Although the student union is really just a small room with a bar (not good), the rest of the facilities are great - the library is up to date and impressive, sports facilitys are awesome and i thought the support you can get on your phone for IT stuff and my classes was good.
I felt supported through my degree here and met amazing people..if you actually engage with the Uni you get alot back - study abroad programs, work placements, career help, internships, competitions and lots of opportunity to feedback problems.
I liked the campus, the little shops and park areas feels like your back in time or at Hogwarts! But the virtual reality lessons and up to date computers made me feel like i was learning on the latest tech.
Def a good uni for Arts degrees, don't know about other ones.",1
"I would never recommend this school if you are pursuing a Masters in Law, researchers students teach you, and also they can be your supervisors which can led you fail your dissertation. No recommended. Student Union doesn’t care about you as Student.",0
"Honestly dreadful compared to other universities that I have attended. Foresterhill campus feels completely disconnected from the main campus. Is there even a students union? Management is poor. Even as a PhD student, I feel ignored by staff.
The city itself is dismal, grey and just dead. Public transport is shocking and overpriced. Student tickets cost more than standard single tickets in other cities.
Don't come here.",0
The library environment is a good resource and the Mc Roberts building is open 24/7 for studying. The zoology museum and botanic gardens is very nice and underrated. Foresterhill is amazing.,1
"Not a very welcoming university, as an international student it is difficult to integrate. The work ethic promoted by the university is not very motivating, teaching and quality of education is poor. Old fashioned run-down campus. Would not necessarily recommend, am changing universities.",0
"The university of aberdeen medical has failed to meet the teaching and professional standards. I have various complaints and concerns about the quality of education that I am getting. The medical school thinks self teaching clinical
Procedures is normal. They harass
International students and do not integrate international students with local students who are not welcoming or friendly.
I would never recommend studying at the University of aberdeen especially th medical school and physician associate program. It was extremely disorganized, racist teachers and students against Americans. The students are screaming and shouting before lectures and always on facebook. The students are very rude and unprofessional and many do not speak proper English. The professors fail to support the student and I do not even have a reagent! The quality of education and standards are th worst I have ever seen! Th city of aberdeen itself is terrines! Grey, depressing and unfriendly! Very rude and trashy",0
"Best student community in the UK, great range of activities (sport and societies), best night outs possible, prettiest library and prettiest campus, leading research center.",1
Great univrsity! THere's always lots of events going on,1
"All close together so easy to get around
Well equippeduo to date technology
No Union club/bar",1
"Lovely campus, great facilities, and an excellent offering of societies for a university of this size. The Students Union is unfortunately in a bit of a mess with a terrible building and too few people getting involved. Rated the career services three stars because I haven't used them - it's a bit silly that they make you rate everything.",1
WE NEED A REAL STUDENT UNION (that doesn't make Aberdeen any less-fun though!),0
Student union doesn't seem to act in favour of the students,0
Taylor library is the best library because nobody goes there. Students tend to be disgusting as they do not know what a paper tissue is.,0
I like Aberdeen university it's pretty fancy and old but the library etc is extremely moderen. The clubs and bars are quite far away as it's not a central university but they're just a bus journey or 10 min taxi ride away (or walk if you can be bothered). ASV is very near which is good.,1
"Truly horrible. The teaching was bland at best, making researchers teach students when they want to be in their labs is a terrible idea. One psych tutor legitimately shouted at me in front of my class for handing in a poor piece of work because I was ill. A mate studying a STEM degree couldn't understand half of his teachers' poor English. We don't have a real union, or a bar, we're half an hour from the dreadful city centre and the bus there costs £5 a day. EVERYTHING is grey, county-wide; and you're so isolated. The halls are actually way out in the countryside with only a Lidl close-by. The uni is decidedly run-down, very 60s. I found other students to be boringly conventional and rude too.
I visited friends at other unis across the UK and the difference in student satisfaction was astronomical. Save your time and go elsewhere",0
Really love it. I would recommend this uni.,1
Very diverse place in terms of people and academics you meet.,1
I think the university is very behind the times and the job prospects are not great. It's all theory and no practical skills are learnt,0
The university has such a beautiful campus which is always buzzing with activity. It does lack a union but the new renovations at hill-head student campus makes sure all freshers are closely linked together. societies are a great way to meet new people with an amazing sports and society fair at the start of the year there no chance of missing sign ups :),1
"While I do realise it might sound like a cliche, I actually feel like I belong here. I realise that my university is not a world-leading insitution but I think it is more student-friendly than others and really cares about students' experience.",1
Although far from home it is amazing!,1
lovely campus. A lovely mix of old and new. The kings college and new kings building are stunning and the Sir Duncan Rice Library is incredible with spectacular views on a sunny day! There is almost every book you could ever need and a catalogue to check if the book is on the shelf.,1
"Very good experience so far, am pleased",1
Haven't signed up to societies yet but there seems to be a big range. Also don't know too much about the union or career options. The campus is gorgeous and the library seems really useful and has been well designed.,1
"Don't know a lot about it yet, it's my first year, but it seems well organized",1
"this place is great, i love it!!",1
Great academic and social experience,1
"Everything I need is on campus. I love love love the key store! Wi-fi is good, and bus 20 is a really good bus connection.",1
one lecturer who is awful though,0
Social activities and groups are really engaging and definitly worth joining. The sports village is great and most other facilities are very good as well.,1
Wifi was slow and crashed during my exam. There were a lot of clubs etc but very expensive.,0
"Love it bar the 'federal' part of the uni. Individual facultys are very strong, societies are amazing and sports wise its very good. Just a shame about the hwole accomodation thing",1
The campus is the most beautiful area in Aberdeen.,1
"Having the mountains on your door step, the ocean on your door step and a fantastic campus with WiFi all over is absolutely brilliant! Brand new facilities are being built and it's a really exciting time to start a degree at the University of Aberdeen! And its not THAT cold....",1
"With great career opportunities after graduating it's no surprise that the University of Aberdeen is one of the best universities not only in Scotland, Britain and Europe. People from all over the world come to study at the university and to experience the beautiful old fashioned campus and the very contemporary library. The city of Aberdeen is just as beautiful as the university and he nightlife is one of the best in Scotland. Studying at the University of Aberdeen will leave you with no regrets and many happy memories!",1
lovely place to study combining historic environment with the future in same place.,1
"I love it here, the law library is especially impressive",1
"Fantastic experience. There's a great sense of community and the clubs and societies are well worth looking at (they are both inclusive and friendly). The university's degree programmes are dynamic and stimulating, and the lecturers are passionate, and for the most part prolific in their fields. I would definitely recommend giving the university a visit to fully appreciate the atmosphere.",1
"The University of Aberdeen is filled with friendly faces and a helpful staff. The opportunities you are presented with both during and after your studies is incredible, and I already feel right at home.",1
"The best place to study! ""Come here, go anywhere""",1
"Fab uni, really welcoming and the courses are fantastic. Great for indecisive people, as changing courses is easy. Give lots of support - just brilliant.",1
"Beautiful. Plenty of facilities for study and learning, you just have to know where to look. Great environments for every kind of learner. Brilliant clubs and societies",1
I'm going to be a fresher there this year and from my point of view everything is excellent!,1
Great university. It's no Oxbridge but it's alright.,1
