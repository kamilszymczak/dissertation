"This year the university has adapted online learning and what a mess it is. It is the worst learning experience I have ever had in my life. 3/6 courses put no effort in and the ones that do are always behind schedule and yet us students has to submit everything in time.
The ones which put in no effort are just impossible to understand what the lecturer is trying to teach. what my A-level teacher explained in three hours was spilt into 6 sections through three weeks and yet I still cannot understand what the lecturer is talking about and had to pull out my A-level notes to help me. This should not be happening. and what is worse is that it's the best one out of the three subjects. The worst one doesn't explain a thing. Lecturer just reads as his cursor moves along the PowerPoint slides and when he gives example questions he says you write this into this and you get this on the right hand side with zero comment on what any of it does. Please do not apply with online learning in place.",0
Good experience here. The professors were knowledgeable and generally approachable but the student development office and the advice and mentorship they offered were amazing. It was definitely a nice mix of academics and social life.,1
it’s just the student support lacking that the uni doesn’t ever seem to want to resolve.,0
"I graduated in 2017 and the absolute waste of life has been eating away at me ever since.
I studied design at the Art School. Coming from an HND course I was admitted into second year, thinking it would be like a continuation of what I had already learned. It was like going back to primary school. Weird conceptual briefs that amount to nothing close I would put in a professional portfolio. One of my first briefs involved picking grass out of the ground and collecting leaves? I was 23 at the time, why are we being treated like 7 year olds? I chose this uni based on prestige and no-one else on my course had been accepted - so assumed it would be top notch. That is a lie - my biggest regret in life was not accepting my 3rd year offer from Dundee, who actually prepare you for jobs in the real world.
Nothing was learned about typography, grid systems, working with clients - y'know, anything that would be useful in preparing us for work.",0
"Capital Uni, expected no less than excellent and that's what it delivers",1
The classes and assignments encourage critical thinking and do broader your knowledge. The administrative staff is great and helpful.,1
"However, sometimes the communication with lectures is not great. Personal tutor system is a good concept but it is highly dependent on who you will have as your PT.",0
"If you're actually looking for an education, the University of Edinburgh is not for you! The professors don't seem to understand that their main purpose is to teach because they don't. They prefer to go on strike and hang out in pubs while their students are left to ""do the readings"" on line. I don't know of any other universities that are happy to take your $30,000 tuition and give you NOTHING!! But the best part is that they only gave us one assessment in the whole semester, where the professors didn't show up to teach, and they picked it apart and failed me!!! When I had barely NO actual class time with a live teacher, I was penalized for their lack of instruction! This school is a sham! They take your money and you get nothing! It's a fraud!",0
The services the university provides are great and the 24 hour libraries are a life saver when you've got to stay up late on an assignment,1
"UoE is a very great university in the UK, and I am very satisfied with the study experience here. Although this year is end up with covid 19, I still think that it is an unforgetable experience in my life.",1
The university offers a large range of courses and the staff are very nice. There are lots of societies to meet others and make friends,1
I had a good study experience here :D,1
"Good place to be, had some amazing times here",1
University of Edinburgh has been top notch.,1
"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! Seriously, whatever you do, DO NOT GO HERE. Professors do not care about students or teaching for that matter. If you have a concern, it will immediately be overlooked, ignored, disregarded by administration. Better off using wikipedia to teach yourself than attend this university and ""learn"".",0
"The University campus is quite spread out but provides a shuttle service, which helps students who have classes in different parts. Staff are approachable and helpful, which helps with transitioning to a new school.",1
Its a great University! Love the location in the centre of town and the faculty is just excellent. Highly recommended.,1
"Overall a welcoming university, a safe place with AMAZING student support. The work load is tough but there is so much in place to help. Societies and club nights on Saturdays are FAB.",1
"Good uni , very good teaching staffs. The library is always packed, a bit hard to find a place to sit down and study.",1
"If you're considering applying for MSc program at Edinburgh University - be careful. From my real experience here which was mutually shared by my overseas students classmates, we can conclude that the University's Masters Programs are pretty much s****** and must be avoid. Why? Let's see.
First, the University considers themselves a research institute. You've probably heard of some famous medical innovation here. But be careful, those renowned academics are NOT the ones who teach you (if you are thinking of doing PhD here, it's another story). And who will be teaching you? According to my cousin, her master program was taught by some PhD students who only had master degree.
Worse, two of the core modules were taught by academic staff who had only Bachelor's Degree. Once, they had an argument about the theory behind the subject, the course lecturer replied something that the course was more about practicality than theory and referred to his work experiences.",0
Nice University but not very well organized.,0
When I Started out at the University of Edinburgh I was very excited and was constantly promised an incredible experience. Since then I have been nothing but disappointed. The people that I’ve met in my program are absolutely incredible and have made the experience worthwhile to me. But the university is one of the most disorganized places I have ever been. Lectures don’t reply to emails. Administrators are constantly making mistakes. If you are trying to bring a complaint forward to have it fixed no one will help you. When it comes to grading there doesn’t seem to be a guideline for what is acceptable. I’m so incredibly disappointed and I wish that there was someone I could talk to at the University to discuss my issues. The university doesn’t seem to care what the students say and therefore do not seem open to accepting feedback and making changes,1
The university has provided key with a lot of great facilities. It has also made me meet other people from around the world.,1
"I don't have much to say. For characters, it's a pretty decent school, all in all.",1
"I chose to study master programme at the Business School here coz it was ranked very high in ranking. I expected very smart and intelligent lecturers. And I was shock that everything was opposite. It is shocking that a university of such ranking can be full of very low profile academia. Most lecturers are those who are not qualified to teach elsewhere. They taught something that the US stopped teaching like 5-10 years ago. promoting students with talent, the university did the exact opposite. It was a complete a waste of time and money studying from second-rate teachers.",0
"Great uni, good for postgraduate.",1
"Wi-fi is always lagging, cant keep websites on keeps crashing due to long wait.",1
the teaching facilities are really good,1
The school is great the University academic staff really care about the students and if you get involved in a sport its a great way to make friends and have something to do in your free-time. The wifi can be dodgy at times and some of the buildings can be interesting but overall its a great school.,1
"Very bad student support, poor lectures, teachers that don't have time to actually teach due to heavy schedules. According to my experience so far, this university is just a money maker.",0
"The main issue I've experienced at the uni is student support. When I first started I emailed my personal tutor to tell her I was struggling and asked for advice. She sent back a very short email telling me she was not a therapist and to contact student support. When I got in contact with student support they literally told me to go to another uni. So on that side of things, the uni is really poor and its easy to feel isolated if you're struggling. The huge emphasis on independent study basically equates to teaching yourself a big chunk of the material. The tutorials are pretty useless. Tutors and feedback can be hit and miss. Some tutors have been brilliant, others not so much. The lectures are good but can be dense at times. The English literature course is traditional, and honestly, pretty stuffy and boring. Needs updating to become more lively and engaging.",0
"Honestly the ECA needs to sort itself out. Tutors in general are useless, and always respond to any face-to-face enquiries with “email me”. You email them to arrange a meeting, you get a response that basically turns the conversation away from what you originally requested and says “just do what you need to do, and... if you need any help just let me know”.
Someone get the tutors some funding and get them in more than 2 days of the week, please.",0
"Edinburgh University is a joke - the teaching quality is poor, and the academic staff does not appear to understand a single thing about running an education. Poor value for money, and you might as well study on your own, because Edinburgh provides NOTHING. Furthermore, the city is rundown and a complete disaster in terms of infrastructure. An absolute s****** and I wonder why this University gets its ranking - likely because of the PG doing research projects here, having had a proper education from elsewhere.",0
It does not have its s*** together.,0
The uni has a good rep which to some extent it lives up to. The library and facilities for the masses are pretty sound. Though I would say they totally mispend their money - upping the gym membership and having very expensive sports club mememberships and making fatal desicions like cutting the bus to the Kings Campus (sciences). The architecture studios are old and a bit tired. They could certainly do with an upgrade as the computer studio is like a dungeon.,1
"Surprisingly beautiful, neat and academically strong",1
"Still new here, but loving what I have seen so far. The attention to detail I have seen them provide in just the accommodation and disability support areas shows me this University stands up to its reputation.",1
Very unorganized university. Shocking for a university that claims to be one of the best in Scotland. Gives wrong exam results AND wrong course allocations without checking. Then despite emails does not fix issues until multiple emails later despite them acknowledging mistakes. Shockingly unprofessional. Would not recommend.,0
"some positives: in first and second year humanities courses you can take a really wide range of outside courses... i studies linguistics but i know people on my course doing outside courses like astronomy, US history, and life drawing.
going to a big uni also has its benefits in that there’s a society for basically anything so it’s easy to find your people.",1
"some criticisms: student support and student counselling is seriously underfunded, and edinburgh’s got a very academic climate that would drive anyone to stress, so i know a lot of people with mental health difficulties.
another criticism is that the student union and student government is incredibly cliquey and dominated by one society, so even with student power it’s really hard to enact change unless you’re friends with the right people
",0
Loved all the time spend at uni,1
"Complete waste of £20,000 -- would never recommend this uni to a friend. I chose UofE based on it's excellent reputation but it seems a good reputation is all it has to offer. Incredibly poor programme organisation and admin, courses are old fashioned and not focused on helping students gain relevant skills for the 21st century, and classes and facilities are massively overcrowded. We sometimes had students sitting on the floor and I often found myself searching for upward of half an hour to find a seat in the library during exam periods. Also, laughably few contact hours (just 8 hours per week in my first semester with a full course load). No help with job placements, no practical experience components, disorganised teaching generally (with a few notable exceptions). Dissertation process was a joke, with my programme having too few supervisors available. It's beyond me where all of the money coming in from a very large international student body is spent. Don't go here.",0
Very happy with the univeristy as a whole,1
"University of Edinburgh is an excellent university with great history. It's facilities are very modern and they will make you feel at home from day one! The refurbished Old College where I mainly spent my time as a law student was simply amazing. So was the main campus next to Meadows Park, the spacious students gym, the students bar etc. They have literally everything arranged for students, so you can just focus on your studies and enjoy your staying here!",1
Nothing to complained abt the facilities. Everythkng ks good I never have any problems with it,1
"Everything as I expected, nothing bad to tell.",1
"Dropped out of Edinburgh to transfer to another university. Poor teaching quality and lack of student community. I wish, looking back, that I had taken its poor student satisfaction in the National Student Survey seriously.",0
I couldn't be happier to have chosen this university for my masters degree!,1
There is no main campus. Campuses are spread over town. If you have to stay over summer and work here Fringe is really annoying.,0
Student Disabiliy Services at the UofE are terrible. If you are a disabled student I would recommend not going to Edinburgh and instead find a Uni that respects you and tries their best to accommodate your learning needs. Edinburgh is riding on their reputation which in the 21st century is no longer deserved.,0
Everything is grand,1
"Considering how much we paid in tuition and the reputation I was quite disappointed. I did an MSc in International Development, and we were hit by the lecturer's strike and didn't have class for about half of the second semester (considering the MSc is only 2 semester it's a massive amount of missed teaching hours). I had a distinction on the 1st semester and lost 10 points on the 2nd as a result. The principal Mathieson gave us a very poor response when we asked for a reimbursement. In the end all we got was a £250 pound voucher for educational activities!",0
"Yeah, the main issue is the wifi, happens to the best of us.",0
" There's study space everywhere, and I would need 20 years at this uni to try all the clubs and societies I would like to join. There is always something on!",1
"As mentioned previously, Edinburgh takes independent study to the extreme. I have finished my first year and I honestly haven't learned anything that I could of by reading the same books at home while working. The 'tutor' system is horrendous, as they state you have four meetings a year to discuss your academic progress. I have had one. Edinburgh has a very privileged student body. If you are not privately educated with a home tutor, I recommend going elsewhere, as you will be isolated quickly.",0
Suck. Low grade academics. Poor teaching quaility.,0
"Awful experience. Courses with no handbooks, lecturers with no experience in the subject matter and worst of all a culture that simply does not care. In my time i never met one student who enjoyed their time at Edinburgh and personally had to console at least two students who were so upset with the Uni they were crying in lectures. Edinburgh treats students like children, is unorganised and the culture is toxic. Please, please please pick another uni based on student satisfaction or just plain gut feeling. Even my letting agent for my flat went here and had a nervous breakdown through the lack of organisation. You have been warned ! Stay away.",0
Very old and prestigeous univeristy. Computer science is in the best courses list of in this university.,1
Really good wifi all around campus so you barely use 4G,1
"The most fantastic 3 years so far that I have experienced, lovely amazing institution, prestigious.",1
"I have two postgraduate degrees from Edinburgh. However my experience here has been terrible. During my first degree, I was strongly encouraged to take interruptions in my course. This unknowingly caused long delays and visa issues. Instead of 3 years, it took 5 to complete. The lack of efficiency was intolerable. As I entered my second degree, the members of staff would often avoid meetings and claim it was due to the weather. I was diagnosed with stress induced epilepsy and received surgery. This was brought up in my department but they denied me special circumstances despite having multiple letters from my neurologist; they claimed insufficient evidence. This was brought up in my departmental meeting, but I was refused the minutes, citing their privacy and despite a whole department discussing my medical status and reading my medical documents. I have threatened legal action and formal complaints, but it is also the university’s style to ignore and sweep everything under the rug.",0
Literally the best 4 years of my entire life. Course was awful but the university is incredible supportive helpful and historic. Made friends for life and had the most amazing experiences.,1
All above are fine - the problem is that the university is too focussed on getting grants for its research - they boasted this year of getting the biggest grant ever awarded to a UK university. Research is obviously important and prestigious when you can say the man who invented anaesthetic effects of chloroform hailed from Edinburgh University but a bit more focus could be put on the students themselves and attention to their mental health and wellbeing - there is a serious imbalance between the two at the moment,1
"I was quickly disappointed. It is surprising that a university of such reputation can be so unorganized. Staff that never replies to emails, classes that I was wondering what we were meant to learn from. Many teachers were not well prepared and I often felt that the independent learning was missing in structure and guidance. And worst of all, the university proudly announces how they help and guide talented students. This was never the case. Instead of caring and promoting students with talent, the university did the exact opposite. It used the ones that had already a reputation to promote itself, by mentioning their names and work in talks, web or open days. The only opportunities I got as a promotion from the university these four years were either a waste of time or lacking completely on proffessionalism.",0
"I've enjoyed my time at Edinburgh so far. There is a lot of study space, a very well-stocked library (vital for humanities research students!), and the Literatures, Languages and Cultures building provides a study space specifically for Postgraduates. Cafes are convenient and serve nice food, the Union bars are cheap (especially for Edinburgh), and there's a huge variety of clubs and societies, with an excellent gym, membership of which gets you free access to a whole host of classes and equipment. I can't comment for the undergrad life unfortunately, but as a postgrad student I'd recommend.",1
It is a great university for international student as they paid a lot but definitely not for non-European staff. Race bias and even racism is quite often and hidden in people's mind. Don't work here if you are non-locals.,1
"The university provides a lot of help in all areas you may require it, staff are polite and welcoming. With the amount of different clubs and societies it's guaranteed that you will find something of interest (or if not, you can start your own society!).",1
"No mistake was made with choosing Edinburgh. The city is beautiful, the sutdents are extremely nice and welcoming and there is always something going on for all sort of interests",1
"awesome time here, the student-led societies and clubs make it an unforgettable experience",1
"I has sexual harassment and bullying and I did formal complaint. They told that I misuderstood and they stopped my studies.
University of Edinburgh is the first in discriminations according to press (search the guardian) Students are objects, threats and fear everywhere. My mental health was affected very badly and they tried to pursuade me that all the proof (messages, email) do not exist. No morals and respect. Avoid this place. Everything is covered. Search all the reviews and stories. People tried to suicide under the pressure and fear to accept everything and not speak.",0
"Eh, it's an okay place to study",1
"Throughout my first year at this university I have felt isolated and my mental health deterioted significantly. I enjoyed the independence of learning at first, however this university takes independent learning too far, as in, I literally havent been taught anything, they only care about students who are exteremely intelligent and don't need any help. I was a straight A student at school, and I failed my exams at this university. It is an enormous uni, and there is no sense of community, to them you are just a number. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I'm transferring to a different uni in september. Also student halls are disgusting and overpriced.",0
Mylnes Court PG has mice. There has been at least 3 mice in my kitchen at one time and I have seen them on multiple occasion (we keep are kitchen spotless and do not leave food around). The school sets poison for them only after you call them many times. They will not set traps because they do not want to personally remove or handle them they also won't come and block the holes.There has been mice in my room as well and I do not keep food laying around. DO NOT go through the schools accommodations it is shameful.,0
"I came to Edinburgh despite their very poor performance in student satisfaction, as the University has a good reputation. Edinburgh is brilliant although the winter is rather cold. French is not too bad, but the department of Spanish is the worst you can think of. The teachers just don't care about you and it is so difficult to get any help from them when you need it. Feedback is always unhelpful. Honestly you will get fed up of reading bad, boring novels.",0
Some major flaws which are carefully hidden from prospective students,0
Great wifi that allow your bank details for stolen online,0
The fact that it is such a huge university with so many students and courses makes it dysfunctional.,0
The only real complaint I can make is the student shops and union ran EUSA are ridiculously expensive for no good reason at all. Don't even get me started on the VKs which cost £2.90. There pubs in Edinburgh that sell pints for £2.90 it doesn't make any sense. EUSA have enough money as it is why do they need to rip off students who are paying f*** tonne to study here.,0
"Campus and facilities are excellent.
Not a part of any clubs as my course is very time consuming but have friends who are and love them. There was also a lot on offer.
Student union is excellent. Not yet used the careers service and in terms of wifi a lot of people complain but I have never had a problem with it.",1
Internet can be patchy.,0
In general a great campus with lots of things to do,1
"Great university, so glad I came here",1
Students union a bit expensive,0
"Campuses are nice, have a lot of student buildings and student activities, everyone will find something they like! And wifi all around the campus + various kind of help.",1
"Great university, To choose to live in the centre of the city would be much more convenient for everything. If you were a medical school student, it was also very convenient to take the bus to the Little France campus, where many medical-related departments and laboratories were located there.",1
The EUSA shops are more expensive than normal supermarkets (Tescom Sainsbury's...) which is a bit of a bummer. Printing is very expensive as well,0
University is what you make of it but Edinburgh has provided me with an excellent experience. There are so many vibrant societies that I have been able to throw myself into and I know I have made friends for life. The campus itself is always exciting with the diversity of people and buildings.,1
"I am just going into my second year of Film and TV Production in Edinburgh College of Art 9which is now part of the university) and I love it. Edinburgh has such great library facilities, they care about their students and all of my tutros have been great.",1
"What a great moment at this University ! I'm a visiting student from France, and i've spent a really good time there !",1
"Not a lot of help to learn though, you have to study on your own a lot.",0
Good quality of education and excellent facilities!,1
"Edinburgh had been a fantastic place for me. The city is wonderul, and it's international community gives the feel that if isn't in a bubble, but is truly a part of the world.",1
"It is right in the city centre so the campus is the perfect for location for socials as well as studying. There are soooo many society's and awards ceremonies that take place to honour there achievements.
If you have a degree from Edinburgh, your sorted... Plus, you can always get your CV or intern applications checked over by the careers service!",1
fantastic university. Enjoyable and the education is among the world's best.,1
"I have had a an amazing first year at Edinburgh University, it's a big uni but still managed to make you feel like you're noticed. Your concerns mean something. The library is my favourite place, the learn system is very useful. Societies, specifically Cricket, have made my time outstanding.",1
Very friendly uni and City. Mechanical engineer student just finished first year and it was unbelievable fun.,1
"Lively and friendly atmosphere on campus, good teaching",1
"I love this uni: great range of subjects, the lectures are fantastic + the societies are loads of fun: I went to Athens with one society, and I've also been to poetry readings and pub crawls and all sorts of other things. And the city is so beautiful!",1
"Amazing institution to study at, with far better facilities than anywhere else I visited. Amazing gym and student union, as well as a beautiful and historical campus.",1
Really good uni. Had such a good time there,1
"fantastic support in place for students, lively campus and great buildings",1
"So far my experience at the University of Edinburgh has been incredible, the staff are extremely helpful and the proximity to the city centre is great.",1
"Edinburgh is a very good uni, the societies are good and the atmosphere is friendly, and (most) of the accommodation is great. Key surf can be a pain but the course and city life is fantastic.",1
"Brilliant city, brilliant university!",1
Brilliant city to live in and a beautiful campus,1
"Great uni and great city. Can't complain of anything. Campus is great, Internet fast and everywhere and the student union is amazing.",1
Beautiful city - beautiful uni - beautiful people,1
An amazing university with an amazing reputation. I am currently gonna be 2nd year student and I'm very excited. The only issue I have is they should provide more clubs and societies but otherwise it's perfect !,1
It's just a great place to learn! Everyone aims to help the best they can. Lectures are always full of the info you need and the reading materials and online work always help summarise. Also lets not forget you get to study in such a great city and experience all it has to offer.,1
"Great university, lovely people and world class facilities. The staff are friendly and are always willing to help anyone who seeks out help. There are a huge number of clubs and societies to choose from. Edinburgh itself is a fantastic city with so much to see and do, including a vibrant nightlife and a great summer festival.",1
I have enjoyed my time in university and would recommend Edinburgh,1
"A vibrant university. Amazing teaching, wonderful people and brilliant opportunities. I love the city and wouldn't want to be anywhere else.",1
teaching is insensitive and not particularly in depth and interesting,0
"University is an important part of my future and coming to Edinburgh has made university exciting, educational and fulfilling. Being here makes me want to stay here and continue learning.",1
"Excellent all round experience, love the people and course is great.",1
"Its beautiful, nice people and instacool muah",1
"High quality teaching, amazing lecturers!",1
"Edinburgh university is great, constantly making sure students are supported academically and personally",1
Don't know what everyone's complaining about. I'm doing psychology BSc (with biology courses) and have found both the George square and kings campuses to be amazing. There's nothing I can criticise about my uni experience so far.,1
It's a great uni in terms of atmosphere and people. ,1
But we are really left to fend for ourselves. They don't really help us develop.,0
"I've thoroughly enjoyed my first year. I recomend that everyone joint a sport, club or society of some sort! It's the perfect thing to balance out your life and your studies.",1
"I absolutely love studying at the University of Edinburgh and am so proud to say I'm a student there! I have had so many amazing opportunities through the university from fully funded travelling trips, leadership roles and positions in societies that will be of great use for my future.",1
"Amazing University, couldn't have made a better choice. Spectacular city with lots of opportunity and has presented me with friends for life!",1
Psychology department aren't the best but the student life is good and having the uni on my resume is good.,1
"I've enjoyed every day I've spent at Edinburgh - the campus and lecturers are brilliant, the course is interesting and challenging and the city is just beautiful. Coming to Edinburgh Uni was the best decision I've ever made.",1
"Edinburgh is great.... Mostly. Amazing campus, great facilities and Teviot (the student union building) looks like it is from Harry Potter.",1
Wonderfully diverse and exciting place to study! Supportive staff and world class lecturers,1
Fun university to go to. Very diverse with the city/campus life put together which makes it great. In a great location with plenty to do. Actual lectures were no where near as good as I thought it would be. Tonnes of socials available and clubs to join in.,1
"Lecturers and the union need to improve their relationships with the students.
Lecturers do not teach the theory well. Mark schemes are not given for past papers, so we're never knowing what we're doing is right.
The union does not care for the rest of us. They only seek to improve their careers down the line.",0
Best university I've ever been to,1
"Satisfaction Is bad as shown by recent stats
Over expensive union
Teaching expected better of a highly ranked uni",0
"Teaching is s***, but I guess that makes our degree all the more impressive",0
"Absolutely brilliant, got everything you could need alongside a world class degree! the city is beautiful, nightlife is lively with options for everyone. There are so many societies, from comedy to trading, debates to a student led think tank. Edinburgh's a world leading university so career opportunities are better than most! the university and city is welcoming, students friendly and staff encouraging!",1
