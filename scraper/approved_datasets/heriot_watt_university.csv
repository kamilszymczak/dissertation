"Awful university with very little going on, and a really grey, boring campus atmosphere",0
"For students equality, the university considered okay but not perfect, they don’t respect international students as the local students are, they use passive aggressive behaviour quite often especially when students don’t have enough English speaking skills or the student is very quiet and shy sometime that happens often",0
"The facility in this university Edinburgh campus are not good as it expected, administration are not very connected to each other and there is no induction training given to the lab. For example if you want to do experiments they don’t show you how many lab you are authorised to access, you will get clash with professional person who responsible for this lab, you have to search and looking and finding a way to finish your experiment
There is no real connections between professional and research supervisor which makes students to be in embarrassing situations. And this confirm that there is no induction training for labs and experiments this is for the facility

"Campus was upgraded and better sport facilities compared to before. The building I was in is quite old. Most lecturers know what they are doing, but depending on the courses. Favourite place is resources center with plenty of spaces go study out of hour.",1
"Most tutors can’t even speak English to an understandable level, how do you expect them to answer questions. And then lecturers don’t even have time to answer questions. They’ll give you so many hints for exams to compensate lack of teaching. But you’re not learning anything. Yeah uni is about self study but there is still help when you need it but not here, you’re on your own. With your own personal tutor giving you crap advice and the disorganised entity. They need to stop milking every penny and care about students wellbeing as well.",0
"This is the worst university. They don’t care about you. They put in touch with a counsellor that didn’t even bloody reply to my emails about the distress I was in. And when complained they didn’t even answer. No regard for student wellbeing at all, don’t get pulled in with propaganda articles. Honestly just the only thing they have going the fact that they market as an international university. Appalled at the lack of care for students. ",0
"This university is a commercial entity, regard for academic progress is only bolstered by the fact that successful applicants pay fees, which then go to research. More importantly they strive for the international contingent, so as to gain more fees whilst subjecting candidates to failing systems, structure, lack of empathy, disregard for mental health issues not to mention but a few failings.
Horrendous institution quite evident when you've circa 40% loss in staff in one year due to unresolved strike action (whilst high ranking staff receive pay rises) and a senior lecturer dismissed for sexual misconduct 'A Scottish university has dismissed one of its professors over allegations he carried out sexual and physical assaults over a 12-year period'",0
by far the best university ive ever been to,1
"An absolute disgrace. The fees for distance learning (building conservation) are simply out of date pdfs and the admin is appalling. Each year they struggled to enrol me on the courses as it was being paid for by my work (""computer says no"" - even though they say they accept sponsor letters you can't enrol on the courses unless you pay upfront with debit/credit card), and then admin ignored my emails until I put in a formal complaint. I sat my most recent exams at an off campus locations (Caledonian University), where they double booked the room and had to scurry around finding me somewhere to sit my exam. Don't go here.",0
"Doing my postgraduate in Heriot-Watt Malaysia. Excellent lecturer, able to link theories and current business conditions. The lecturer very helpful (willing to guide you anytime). Internet connection stable, online library accessible any part of the world!!(you not require to physically in the campus). Student portal; vision is user friendly and systematic. If you working adult, this university able to add value in your career.",1
This is an absolute pleasure service from the management and you'll get necessary suggestions from the management in time when need. All the campuses are helpful to serve you information and this is really a great platform to learn.,1
I absolutely love attending Heriot-Watt University! It is such a beautiful campus and the people are incredible. Everyone should come here. The best hall is Anna Macleod. Come visit me sometime in room F18.,1
"The campus is pretty and welcoming, if not a little boring, however it is what you make of it and it is extremely good at teaching things practically rather than idealistically",1
Best univ for actuarial science!,1
"In 2012, wishing to study in a UK university, I turned toward Heriot-Watt university. University that had been recommended to me at the time by an academic advising office.
I had never heard about Heriot-Watt; but I had noticed that this Uni was very present on internet and social media. Also, the University had different campuses, in Scotland (the main one), in Malaysia, in Dubai and in London.
My acceptance and integration on the basis of student credits transfer has been done rapidly and easily.
Once studying at Heriot-Watt London, the lectures were interesting but the academic organisation as the administration were very messy. The relationships between lecturers and academic staff were sometimes conflicting which was embarrassing for students.
The academic staff turnover was incredibly high (during my degree I met more than 5 different academic advisors or registrars), and the indications given by them were most of the time strange and confusing.",0
"In general good facilities, there are some incidents of clear abusement of PhD students and bossy behavior by lectures with he university taking no action towards the lecturers and covered the situtation for reputation reasons.",1
"Do not consider going here for a postgraduate! You will regret it, as I do.",0
Very modern and always working hard to improve facilities and student experience. Wide range of facilities from a shop to cafes to a state of the art sports facility. A lovely place with very helpful staff,1
This uni is terrible went to all the lectures and learnt nothing. Teachers seemed as though they could not be bothered to teach they always ended lessons 15-30 mins early. Teachers took weeks to reply to emails. No learning took place it was a teacher reading word for word of a slide that we had access to online most people barely ever went to the lectures and I dont blame them. It seems as though everything is about money with this school take my advice and think twice before coming here waste of money waste of time,0
As a HW MBA alumnus with a specialism (2003 and 2005) and 6 doctor-level courses completed I am reminded everyday how much I have benefited from their most topical and challenging academic standards. It has really helped me to develop 'mental mettle'.,1
Not a lot on in the student union but sports facilities and clubs are good. There is WiFi across the campus and there are good food facilities on campus. The buildings are all connected and are at most a 15 minute walk from one side to the other.,1
"Very bad value for money
Depressing campus, remote from the city
Very old student malls still from the seventies
Bad food
I paid about 7800 pounds for a Masters programme. Bad support and communication by university staff, nothing individual, very superficial. Your grade heavily depends on how smartly you chose your supervisor. Some of the staff of the School of Life Sciences cannot be bothered to reply to emails relating to their courses. Campus: Pretty depressing atmosphere, student halls in very old buildings (Campus was build in the seventies). I hope that other British Universities offer top quality for the money they take.",0
"The campus is very relaxed with a good atmosphere! Compared to other universities though, the Students Union isn't as active and there are not that many active societies.",1
"Heriot Watt is a good ""international"" university, where you can explore and experience different culture form all international students. Although I only give one star on some parts, the uni is aspiring and expending. After all, I still recommend here. Welcome to HW!",0
Even though the uni is rather average I'm really enjoying my time here and have met some great people,1
"A very good standard of teaching and a very diverse range of programmes to chose from. Opportunities to travel and study abroad at Heriot watt Malaysia or dubai campus.The library is 24/7 during term time, a facility that is used by many students.",1
Great University in a lovely location!,1
"Bit far from things, on campus supermarket would be good, as well as more union events. But teaching really good and campus really beautiful",1
