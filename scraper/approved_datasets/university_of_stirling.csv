review,score
Some lecturers can be extremely incompetent and you need to keep on top of things.,0
A great place to study depending on the course.,1
"I love it here, especially the study abroad program",1
"The uni is good and the staff is very helpful to students, lessons and seminars are great and there's a huge presence of international students, which is good. On the other hand, Stirling town is small and pretty boring, but fortunately there are several trains to other cities.",1
"From a post-graduate perspective, it seems as if the university doesn't really care about my cohort. I attempted to be very involved and still felt not apart of the school or really got value for the money I spent there.",0
"I had such high expectations before coming to this university, looking back now I regret going there. I did not learn any new skills attending this university. The lecturers are not organized and rarely helpful. The staff is rarely helpful especially the accommodation office. I lived on campus and the laundry machines there were broken. They are still not fixed after 6 months. Student accommodation is not good. The houses are old, rusty and dirty.",0
Nothing is organized at this university. Staff is rarely helpful. Did not learn new skills from attending the lectures.,0
some issues with planning - one lecture had at least ten people sitting on the floor due to no space but quickly solved once students stopped showing up. Can be very confusing in your first semester and i struggled to find any information.,0
"Nice school, Very good social clubs! join them!!",1
"Great campus, environment and sporting facilities. I'm studying economics and my first year has been great!",1
"Plenty of facilities available to use like the astro pitches, gym, launderette and more. Wi-Fi is fast but sometimes inconsistent. Plenty of societies to join and there are always events on.",1
I wouldn't say I was ashamed to go here but I won't actively tell people. The computer science course is thankfully changing but it is still quite outdated with bad facilities in the computer science department. Its a shame as the lecturers are good people and try very hard. The accommodation is expensive and the transport from town to campus are a nightmare as First bus has a monopoly and the university doesn't care. The university does not prioritize students and I feel like the library is the only facility that cares. Results come out late and feedback is spacey,0
Terrible students union/accommodation services however.,0
"Campus is great as most of the accommodation is all bundled together which is ideal in first year as it's really easy to make and meet friends. Societies are really good too, everyone is really accommodating and friendly. You just have to man up and go to the give it a go's and you'll find it wasn't nearly as scary as you thought it would be.
Unions is good, cheap drinks nice food and karaoke night is always fun.
I haven't made use of the careers service so can't review that. Internet is reliable and works for all my devices it just sometimes take a minute to reconnect.",1
"Absolutely beautiful campus, accommodation is a bit expensive but worth it, the grocery store and restaurants/delis on campus are expensive as hell so wouldn't suggest shopping there, take the bus into the city centre and get your groceries there. Other than that, beautiful study areas(indoor and outdoor), fantastic student help services, and an overall incredible experience.",1
"The campus looks really cool from the outside, but the university has a lot of problems. This is a university motivated by money and not student welfare. Exam results are never posted on time and support staff are few and have a high turnover. On campus accomodation is appalling especially for postgraduates and very overpriced. Returning students are always evicted from their accomodation in mid August until mid September and expected to go find somewhere else to live. Teaching staff are mostly on zero hours contracts, so tend to disappear after lectures.",0
The location is beautiful.,1
But studying facilities are not good.,0
"I would not recommend, the course does not worth to go. The learning content is outdated, no relevant modern theories, we discussed case studies 10 years ago, and all students were bored doing something else like facebook for whole class. Lectures trying to not spend their time on teaching, slides in classes are very poorly made with mistakes every week, they tell students they cannot give academic advice because they are marking, feedbacks on assignments are just stupid, we don't get any feedback on our presentations. Administrations are awful, always very late and some students could not attend a study trip because of their faults, takes more than a month to make an appointment with tutors.",0
Great University. Campus is beautiful and students and lecturers are all helpful and friendly. 10/10 would go to uni here.,1
"Just perfect. The most beautiful campus on Earth! Kind staff, organised university and excellent facilities.",1
"Everything is great, except the wifi.",1
"Clubs and Societies are the best part of uni, I would have had a completely different experience if I hadn't joined any.",1
Up to date state of the art facilities with a mind boggling selection of sports and recreational activities for all levels of competence.,1
Really enjoying my time here. It's a great campus and lots to do.,1
"The University of Stirling is overall a very good university. They are very flexible and understanding, and most lecturers are very talented. The campus is beautiful, and near the town (which is very useful.) Transportation is easy, and overall I find the teaching very good.",1
"I haven't really been introduced to the career opportunities yet, but I love how everyone's s helpful and polite",1
"Amazing campus!! Can't walk 5 mins outside without seeing a squirrel or a rabbit. The Loch is lovely too. Lots of dog walkers. Uni buildings are close to each other and relatively modern. Food available is good but expensive. It's very handy to have things like a pharmacy and bookshop on campus, but again very expensive.
Clubs + Socs are expensive and clique-y, nothing caught my interest. All the give-it-a-gos are pubcrawls which isn't great if you're under 18. The sports clubs are also not very accommodating to casual players/beginners. I met lots of friends in the few clubs I tried but otherwise it's not worth it unless it's something you really care about.
Don't know much about career opportunities but there's some brilliant study abroad options for all degrees.",1
"Excellent library with thousands of good material to read, a lot of computers and a 24 hour bit which is helpful. University is clean and has a lovely view!",1
"Really fun uni to be at, always something on in the Atrium and a variety of clubs to join",1
Uni is okay. Not part of any clubs so I have no idea (being nursing student doesn't leave much time for that). No idea about career opportunities but it's never been made an obvious thing to me.,1
I love my university. The camp is amazing and the choice in degree programmes and modules are wonderful,1
"The campus is beautiful and for it not being my first choice, I am glad that into Stirling. I like how it isn't too modern like most universities these days",1
Love my university offer so much support and guidance and have the best sports facilities all in the one location!,1
"The student union is such a nice relaxed place to go for food and drinks, the gym is to class and the campus is beautiful on a nice day",1
"Living on campus during first year is a must, such an amazing experience.",1
"The campus and facilities are amazing I love this university! Internet can occasionally be slow, some halls are very outdated but are in the middle of being upgraded!",1
"Great uni, sometimes lacking in contact hours, very hard to get part time work but a brilliant place to be, awesome social life.",1
"Beautiful campus, handy location, lots of variety",1
"Stirling University is beautiful, if the surroundings can't inspire you I do not know what will. Sitting in the library looking at the views makes it less monotonous. Halls are a brilliant experience, but I wouldn't pay the extortionate prices for the newer buildings - spend that extra money on booze to bond with your new flat mates. The only downfall to the uni is the lack of available modules for your specified course. Taking additional modules in a subject you have no idea about is annoying especially when you have to try and pass the module!",1
"just a great all round uni, loving it so far.",1
"I can't help but get the feeling that this university tries very hard to milk every penny from our pockets. Overpriced facilities, cafes and shops on campus in which obnoxious staff members sell food low in quality are prime examples. The porters in the halls of residence seem like they have been dragged through hell for most of their life and exhibit their misery onto students all too keenly. The student union is useless. I have remained completely uninterested with their activities since freshers week (3years ago).
The best part of this university is the sports facilities which I cannot fault. I haven't had much activity with the careers office but it appears to be competent.
In conclusion this university has so much potential to fulfill but has failed to come even close to doing so.",0
"The campus itself is stunning to look at, the buildings not so much. Although they are rebuilding halls at the moment. The staff in my faculty are friendly and helpful but I have heard otherwise from friends in their subjects. Jobs are hard to come by unless you have experience due to the small size of the area. Generally I great place to study, although I wouldn't want to live here forever.",1
So friendly and welcoming! Plus the campus is just amazing!,1
Fantastic facilities and environment to study in. Clubs and Societies are brilliant and certainly make the University so much more enjoyable!,1
"It's an amazing university, the campus is stunning and it truly offers everything one could want and more. It has a great community spirit and has a range of sports teams to join, from American football to quidditch - as well as all sorts of societies too. The student union is great also, and if you feel like going somewhere different for a change you can hop on the bus into town and there are plenty of other places to go to. 96% of graduates go onto employment or further study 6 months after graduating and the Internet/wifi is really fast - it very rarely let me down if at all. All in all, a class environment to study in.",1
Very disorganised and not very good at getting important information to students.,0
Campus is stunning. Support for students and careers centre is great! Gym and pool is fab but costly even with student discount.,1
"The parking is awful, it seems Stirling take money off students wherever they possibly can, lecturers are also uninthusiastic",0
Great uni! Fantastic tutors and brilliant library. Sad to leave,1
"I graduated from University of Stirling this June and I must say that I have had some of the best years of my life, at least this far at this university.",1
"Stirling is beautiful, the loch is stunning. The university is very personal to the student which enhances the experience!!",1
Stirling university was the best decision I have ever made. The campus provides a tranquil place to study and provides a sense of community amoung students. The staff at stirling university never made me feel alone I have always felt supported and I know that help was always there if I needed it. I would recommend this university to everyone especially prospective undergraduates.,1
Very happy in Stirling university,1
There may just be two clubs but Stirling students sure know how to partyyy! DUSK AND FUBAR,1
"Best university in Scotland. Great atmosphere, great campus, great students and staff. Couldn't ask for better!",1
"amazing campus and views, great sports facilities and loads of different clubs societies to join",1
Amazing uni. Laid back feel and very supportive staff. Highly recommended!,1
It's basically a town ran by students,1
"Gorgeous campus with great facilities, lots of clubs to choose from. Easy to find your way as there are only two buildings.",1
"Stirling campus has the most beautiful scenery as well as super cool people, union and curly fries(everyone's fave)",1
This uni has a really relaxed atmosphere both in the campus and in the city and a whole. The lecturers are very helpful and there's a club/society for everyone. One of the best sporting universities with great sport facilities!,1
I could not have had a better 4 years. Stirling is everything I could have asked for & more. Duch a beautiful environment and community to learn in. Thank you Stirling.,1
Amazing university and can't think of one issue I have with it!! Had an amazing two years and feel like I've grown so much being here. Wouldn't change it for the world. Except for maybe a subway or something in the main campus area..,1
Highland campus has no clubs or union that's any good.,0
Such a good uni it has prettiest campus and amazing staff. The uni has a laid back approach but amazing teaching for academia,1
The campus is beautiful and all contained in one place instead of spread out like many other unis are. Actual courses are fab too.,1
It's all good except the union which is pretty s***,1
"Beautiful campus, wonderful fellow students, decent course, good freshers week, however staff do not post exam results online like they are supposed to, poor on campus facilities, buses to Stirling are far too expensive, and worst of all the price for campus accommodation can only be described as exploitative, as the cost is extortionate and the dorms are in utterly revolting condition. I would recommend the university, however it has some key issues that need improving immediately. I would not recommend living on campus.",0
Fantastic environment and gorgeoud scenery. The clubs and societies provide great opportunities to meet life long friends.,1
The campus contains everything you could ever need in a beautiful friendly environment. The staff are always very helpful and the courses are designed to give you plenty of actual practical experience.,1
The campus is beautiful and it offers over 100 clubs/societies!,1
I'm study in the highland campus in Inverness. There is no students union or any club or societies up here. The accommodation is also not very appealing. The placements are great as you get to see rural Scotland however sometimes the university is not accommodating when you have finical issues and can't afford your 'away' placement. Overall it is a great uni with just some minor issues in the highland campus.,0
Wifi drops off easily and applying for accommodation is stressful,0
